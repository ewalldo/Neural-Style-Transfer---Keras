# Neural-Style-Transfer---Keras
Neural Style Tranfer using Keras and VGG19 network

Implementation of the Neural style transfer image modification technique using Keras/tensorflow and the pretrained convnet

Change the variable 'target_image_path' (Line 13) to the target image that you want
Change the variable 'style_reference_image_path' (Line 14) to the style reference image

The final resolution can be changed by the variables img_height and img_width respectively (Lines 17 and 18)

The number of iterations is controlled by the variable 'iterations' at the line 115


Here is an example using a dog picture as an target and Vincent van Gogh's picture "The Starry Night" as an reference
